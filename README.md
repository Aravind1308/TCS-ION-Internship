This project aims to develop a classification model for predicting the side effects of a drug based on age, gender, and race. The objective is to create a dataset, clean and preprocess the data, and build a classifier that can accurately classify the side effects of a drug. The project follows a linear strategy, involving data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature processing, and data partitioning. Several classification algorithms, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, linear SVM, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting, are considered for model development. The dataset consists of patient reviews, conditions, drug information, ratings, and other attributes. The results reveal the most effective classification model and provide insights into the demographics and conditions associated with drug usage and side effects. Overall, the project aims to meet industry standards and provide valuable insights into drug safety and effectiveness.
